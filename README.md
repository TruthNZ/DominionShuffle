# DominionShuffle
Dominion Shuffle is an Android App to randomly select a set of cards for the card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion">Dominion</a>.

This is a fork of http://sourceforge.net/projects/dominionapp/

Dominion Shuffle was originally created by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/j0ran">Joran Jessurun</a>, and then later maintained by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/mark-mixson">mark-mixson</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/na3blis">na3blis</a>

This was forked in order to update it for the new Expansions.

Despite the many other Dominion Shuffling Apps out there, I chose to update this one because I like the ability to select limits and optional conditions. I also happen to prefer the interface over the other Apps.
