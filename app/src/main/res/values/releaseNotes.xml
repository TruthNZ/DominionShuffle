    <string name="releasenotes_value">++ Version 1.10 ++\n
Added ability to draw more or less than 10 cards.\n
Don\'t draw Potions, Ruins, Spoils, or Supplementary cards (e.g. Madman for Hermit) - These aren\'t needed in the App, as you should know to grab them when you pull out the other card.
Disabled Card Language Selector (since it\'s currently broken, apologies again to non-English speakers).
Moved both of the above options into a single Settings area.
\n
++ Version 1.9 ++\n
Built upon Joran Jessurun\'s version\n
Added Adventures Cards\n
Added Events, and updated behaviour to not count Events against drawn Kingdom Cards.\n
\n
++ Known Bugs ++\n
Non-English Languages are not working (Sorry).\n
Forcibly selecting a non-Kingdom Card (e.g. Potion, Platinum, Shelters, an Event, etc.) sometimes results in more or less than 10 actual Kingdom cards being drawn.
